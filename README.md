# Database Query Optimization

### Objective:
The goal is to create a system that automatically detects poorly performing queries in a database and suggests or applies optimizations (e.g., adding indexes, changing queries, etc.). The system would analyze queries for performance bottlenecks and provide actionable insights to improve database performance.

### Key Features of the Project:

#### 1. Query Performance Monitoring:

Track query execution times, CPU usage, disk I/O, and other relevant metrics.

Collect query execution plans to understand how the database engine executes each query.

#### 2. Identification of Slow or Inefficient Queries:

Use execution plans to identify inefficient queries, such as those with missing indexes or those that perform full table scans.

Highlight queries that take a long time to execute or utilize excessive resources.

#### 3. Suggest Query Optimizations:

Provide suggestions for adding indexes, optimizing SQL syntax, or breaking complex queries into simpler ones.

Recommend query restructuring (e.g., using JOIN instead of subqueries or optimizing filter conditions).

#### 4. Automated Optimization (optional):

Automatically add missing indexes based on query patterns or suggest changes to the queries.

Optionally, implement automated query rewrites or index management.

#### 5. Reporting and Alerts:

Generate reports of slow or inefficient queries.

Set up alerts when certain performance thresholds (e.g., query duration, CPU usage) are exceeded.

#### 6. User Interface (optional):

Build a dashboard or simple interface to visualize query performance metrics and optimization suggestions.

### Technologies You Can Use:
Databases: SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle (or any relational database).

### Monitoring Tools: 
Use built-in database tools (e.g., SQL Server Profiler, MySQL EXPLAIN) or third-party tools for performance insights.

### Programming Language: 
Python or SQL.

### Version Control: 
Git and GitHub to track changes and updates.

### Steps to Implement the Project:

Setup Monitoring for Slow Queries <br>
Use SQL Profiler (SQL Server), EXPLAIN (MySQL/PostgreSQL), or Query Performance Insights to capture slow-running queries.<br>
You can use scripts to periodically fetch query execution times, CPU usage, and other relevant data. <br>
Use any monitoring tool to get the relevant details.
